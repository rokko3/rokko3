**`Vulnerability Searcher - Outside of the box thinker`**

I'm a computer science student looking foward to solve hard code problems and accomplishing goals in my daily life. What i have is not a mindset, it is a life style of a cracker. Cybersecurity is my favourite part of technology. All work i do is planned from bottom, a little of try-error, implementation and solved requirements.
